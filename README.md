# WH Okna Bazy Extensions

This is the official Bazy Extension project - Bazy Plugins. You can clone this repository and build on top of it own Extensions. In this repo you will find two projects:
- BazyExtension,
- ExamplePlugin.

BazyExtension - is a main Bazy plugin manager. You can write based on this code your own plugin manager or even omit this manager and create a direct Bazy plugin.
ExamplePlugin - this is an example plugin that is used by Plugin Manager from this solution.

Please notice that this solution is only a concept solution. You can find help here on how to write your own Bazy plugins or you can contribute to this project and provide your energy to make this peace of software better.

Remarks:
- Plugins in Bazy are available starting from WH Okna version: 6.3.1.201.
- WH Okna in version 6.3.1.201 is compiled in .Net 4.6 so we strongly recommend to build plugins in this version of Microsoft Framework.
